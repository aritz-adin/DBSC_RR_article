# A clustering adjusted regression model to identify extreme risks in small areas
This repository contains the R code to fit with INLA the spatial models described in the work entitled _"Identifying extreme COVID-19 mortality risks in English small areas: a disease cluster approach"_ [(Adin et al., 2022)](10.21203/rs.3.rs-864393/v1). It also contains the necessary functions to reproduce all the figures and tables of the article.
